ideas:

    * calibrate a starting location/home base, could use joy stick pushbutto to decide this
    * keep track of location of the car relative to the home base (could incorporate whatever george has with this)
    * when metal is detected it will save the xy cord into a list or something, maybe a dict
    * can map the whole thing out into like a treasure map of where all the coins are hidden
